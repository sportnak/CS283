The program that I provided implements a multi threaded server responding a series of transactions. It calculates the total at the end and keeps track of the treads in an object created in the main server class. Once all of the main threads have been activated (number of threads for multithreaded test plus one for single threaded and then one for shutdown), the server closes itself and the threads work themselves to completion. The computation comes out correct.
